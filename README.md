## About

This project is a Python implementation of an image processing and captioning pipeline. The application, encapsulated in the `full_pipeline.ipynb` file, integrates various advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models. It provides functionalities such as denoising, colorization, and image classification, alongside generating captions for images using a pre-trained model. Additionally, the pipeline includes mechanisms to artificially add noise to images and subsequently denoise them, followed by evaluating image quality through various metrics.

This project was undertaken during my fifth year of engineering studies (Bac+5 in the French education system) as part of a school assignment, offering an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with artificial intelligence concepts such as AI classifiers and denoising models. Working in a group of five, we collaborated to design and implement the pipeline, enhancing both our technical expertise in Python and our teamwork skills.

## Installation

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victor-Pavageau/ImageProcessingAndCaptioning.git
```

## Usage

To run the pipeline

- Open the project in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Run all the code cells and follow instructions in the Gradio UI

> Since the [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) repository, a dependency of the ImageProcessingAndCaptioning pipeline, was archived in October 2024, the pipeline may encounter issues during execution.

## Status
